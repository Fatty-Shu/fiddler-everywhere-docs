# Welcome to Fiddler Everywhere!

Thank you for choosing [**Progress® Fiddler Everywhere**(https://www.telerik.com/fiddler-everywhere)]! The __Fiddler Everywhewre__ client is web debugging proxy. The client can be installed on Windows, Linux, Mac systems and supports multitude of different browsers and programs. Locally running programs like web browsers, MS Office applications, and other clients send their HTTP and HTTPS requests to Fiddler Everywhere, which then forwards the traffic to a web server. The server’s responses are then returned to Fiddler Everywhere, which passes the traffic back to the client. Fiddler Everywhere can display and modify the encrypted requests by decrypting the HTTPS traffic using a man-in-the-middle technique.

## Help us Improve the Fiddler Everywhere Documentation

We believe the documentation is at its best when the content is a product of collaboration between the builders and consumers of that product. Everybody can play a role in making our documentation better, and we encourage you to help us with that task in the way that you choose:

### Send Feedback

Use the __Was this article helpful?__ functionality to give us feedback and idfeas on how we could improve the documentation.

### Create an Issue

If you find an issue with our docs that needs addressing, the best way to let us know is by creating an issue in our [Github repository](https://github.com/telerik/fiddler-everywhere-docs). When creating an issue, please provide a descriptive title, be as specific as possible, and link to the documentation in question. If you can provide a link to the closest anchor to the issue, that is even better.

### Send a Pull Request

Creating an issue is great, but what we love are pull requests. So, if you find an issue in the docs, or even feel like creating new content, we’d be happy to have your contributions! 

The necessary steps are that you fork our documentation and submit a pull request. That way, you may contribute to exactly where you found the error. After that, our technical writing team needs to approve your change request. Please use only standard markdown. For more detailed instructions, please follow the [contribution instructions](https://github.com/telerik/fiddler-everywhere-docs#contributing) published in GitHub.
