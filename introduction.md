## Welcome to Fiddler Everywhere!

Thank you for choosing [**Fiddler Everywhere**](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler-everywhere) web debugging proxy. The client can be installed on Windows, Linux, and macOS systems and supports a multitude of browsers and programs. Locally-running programs like web browsers, MS Office applications, and other clients send their HTTP and HTTPS requests to Fiddler Everywhere, which then forwards the traffic to a web server. Then, the server’s responses are returned to Fiddler Everywhere, which passes the traffic back to the client. Fiddler Everywhere can display and modify the encrypted requests by decrypting the HTTPS traffic using a man-in-the-middle technique.

## Fiddler Everywhere Pro

All Fiddler Everywhere features are available in both the **Free** and the **Pro** version. However, the **Fiddler Everywhere Pro** version dramatically extends the free version's sharing and collaboration options. The free version has some limitations related to sharing quotas. Refer to the table below for a detailed comparison of the Free versus Pro versions.

| __Features__ |  __Free__ | __Pro__ |
|---|---|---|
| Capture and Inspect Traffic | **Unlimited** | **Unlimited** |
| Creating Composer Requests | **Unlimited** | **Unlimited** |
| Using Auto Responder Rules | Up to 2 rules simultaneously | **Unlimited** |

| Shared Snapshots Size | Max 5 MB | Max 50 MB |

>tip A **Snapshot** in Fiddler Everywhere is a term that describes an entry that holds single or multiple sessions (captured traffic). Saved snapshot entries are listed in [the **Sessions** list]({%slug saved-sessions-tab%}) and can also be exported as [**SAZ** archive]({%slug file-menu%}).
