# Share Captured Web Traffic

Fiddler Everywhere provides great opportunities for team collaboration via personal accounts. Each logged user can save, export, import, receive and share sessions with other users. Users can save sessions as entries in the __Saved Sessions List__, export them as known sessions format, save them as SAZ archives and they can also receive shared sessions. A shared session can contain custom comments left by the creator, making the team collaboration even more effective. In this article, we will go through the several options to save captured traffic and share it with other users.

## Share from Web Sessions List

The __Web Sessions List__ provides a context menu available for each captured session (right mouse click). Sharing a session (or a number of selected sessions) is as easy as selecting __Share__ from the context menu and going through [the required steps]({%slug web-sessions-list%}#share).
