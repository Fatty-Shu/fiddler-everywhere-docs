## Fiddler Everywhere Collaboration

The Fiddler Everywhere client provides for easy and secure sharing of network debugging logs within your teams for quick analysis, communication, and resolution.


## Save and share sessions

Network sessions captured by Fiddler Everywhere can be saved into workspaces and replayed later. These same sessions can also be shared with your teammates! Simply use the sharing features of Fiddler Everywhere and invite other team members to collaborate.


## Add context for teammates

Some network sessions can be missing important context that is not captured in the technical details. Fiddler Everywhere allows you add context to sessions by adding comments. Your peers as well can add information to the same comment thread for full communication and collaboration.


## In-app collaboration

In previous versions of Fiddler Everywhere, collaboration was limited to exporting .saz files and emailing back and forth. Now all sharing and commenting happen directly within the Fiddler Everywhere UI, providing a much easier and secure manner of collaborating with your team.


## Fiddler Everywhere Pro

Collaborate and achieve even more with the Fiddler Everywhere Pro perks.
