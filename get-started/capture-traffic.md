## First Steps in Capturing Web Traffic

Once Fiddler Everywhere is [installed]({%slug installation%}) and [configured]({%slug configuration-get-started%}) , it is time to utilize the main feature of the proxy client - Web traffic capturing. The client logs all HTTP and HTTPS traffic between your computer and the internet. You can analyze and debug the incoming & outgoing traffic from virtually any application that supports a proxy (like Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Teams, Outlook, etc.). The already captured traffic can be used to debug issues, find performance bottlenecks, or share it with your teammates.

Capturing traffic with Fiddler Everywhere is as easy as executing two steps:

1. Start Fiddler Everywhere. Make sure that it is [properly configured]({%slug configuration-get-started%}).

2. Switch **Live Traffic** to **Capturing**. 

That's it! Your incoming and outgoing traffic will be immediately captured and displayed in the [Web Sessions List]({%slug web-sessions-list%}).

## Next Steps

Now that your traffic is captured, the next steps are to inspect it in detail. Learn more about [inspecting traffic with Fiddler Everywhere]({%slug inspecting-traffic-get-started%}).
