#### What is the Fair Usage Policy? 

Most of our product licenses include unlimited access to the support service. In order to keep providing our industry-leading level of support, we have instituted a fair usage policy for our support services: 

A support manager will review customer activities that exceed at least ten times the average amount of support requests to determine if such activities are deemed to be excessive. 

#### How to create a support ticket? 

A support ticket can be created by sending an email to support@getfiddler.com
