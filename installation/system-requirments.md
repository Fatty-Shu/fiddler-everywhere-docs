> Note: By default, Fiddler Everywhere can be installed and used without administrative rights if you need to capture non-secure HTTP traffic. However, for capturing secure traffic (HTTPS), the user will need administrative rights to install and trust a root certificate (more [here]({% slug decrypt-https-traffic %})).
