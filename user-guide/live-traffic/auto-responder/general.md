# Auto Responder

The __Auto Responder__ is one of the most powerful features of Fiddler Everywhere. It enables you to create __rules__ that will automatically trigger in response to requests. The functionality provide means to easily and quickly test changes to web code without updating the production server, to reproduce previosly captured bugs (in SAZ files), or to run website demost while being entirely offline.

1. Click the __Auto Responder__ button
