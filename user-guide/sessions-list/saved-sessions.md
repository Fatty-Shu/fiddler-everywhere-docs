## Sessions

The Fiddler Everywhere client provides the opportunity to save and share the captured traffic (a.k.a. __snapshots__ of sessions). Use the __Live Traffic__ list's [__Save__]({%slug web-sessions-toolbar%}#save) and [__Share__]({%slug web-sessions-toolbar%}#share) options to add snapshots to the __Sessions__ list. The saved snapshots are available for later usage and sharing in the __Sessions__ list.

## Sessions Menu

Once a snapshot (of sessions) is saved (or saved & shared) it will be appended to the __Sessions__ list. Each snapshot comes with quick menu options.
